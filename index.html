    <h2 class="section-heading">How do we build and deliver software awesomeness!</h2>
    <p>Let’s hear it from our clients…</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
      <p class="text1" style="text-align: justify;">It is with great enthusiasm and confidence that I recommend TechO2 team for any and all of your full-service software development needs. For the past two years I have had the honor and privilege to work with TechO2 as they’ve supported us in the ideation and development of our web-based education platform. During this time, I have experienced firsthand the meaningful and authentic relationship that TechO2 leadership builds with their clients, as well as marveled at the way in which the team have worked tirelessly (and patiently) to build us software that aligns precisely with our vision and specifications. Not only does TechO2 have the ability to create robust and responsive software, but they also know how to ask just the right probing questions to help startup founders truly understand and unpack the product they are trying to build!

        Prior to partnering with TechO2 on this project, we had endured a painful relationship with another software development company. Despite our initial reservations, we were absolutely blown away by how markedly different our experience was with the TechO2 team. First, TechO2 leadership is committed to doing whatever it takes to form a true partnership. TechO2 team makes themselves available at all hours of the day, and approaches every conversation and interaction as if you’re their only customer. They bring a level of excitement and commitment to their work that matches the enthusiasm of the startup founders, and have an uncanny ability to troubleshoot problems before they occur. I’ve also been thoroughly impressed by the way TechO2 engineers recognize even the smallest tweaks that can be made to benefit the user-experience. It’s like a sixth sense.
        
        I’d also be remiss if I didn’t speak to the organization and professionalism of TechO2 leadership and their team. Throughout the entire development process roles and tasks were clearly defined. Additionally, the level of communication was unparalleled - not just with the software development team, but with the leadership as well! Questions were answered in a quick and timely manner, we utilized a web-based platform (Jira) to monitor the entire build, and could easily contribute our input and feedback to any member of the TechO2 team and see that feedback implemented with fidelity.
        If your organization is looking for a developer and team that is willing to go above and beyond to ensure you build the best possible software, look no further than the team at TechO2. We did, and it’s changed our lives!
